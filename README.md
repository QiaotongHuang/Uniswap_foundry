# UniswapV2 Project

## Project Goals

The primary objectives of this project are to:

- Gain in-depth understanding of the UniswapV2 implementation.
- Familiarize with Foundry, the next generation Ethereum development environment.
- Utilize online resources effectively for project completion.

## Project Overview

### UniswapV2 Code Review

- Review the UniswapV2 codebase, including:
  - [Uniswap/v2-core](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-core)
  - [Uniswap/v2-periphery](https://github.com/Uniswap/v2-periphery)
  - [Class notes](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1nrstvabIItERQb-ilnnnlwSX49nQOIA8/view?usp=share_link) by Jichu Wang, a former student at NEU

### Project Setup

- Copy the UniswapV2 code into a new Foundry project.
- Combine core and periphery contracts into a single repository for streamlined development.
- Copy required libraries instead of relying on package management.
- Exclude UniswapV2Router01 from the project.

### Solidity Version Upgrade

- Upgrade the UniswapV2 codebase to the latest Solidity version supported by Foundry.

### Solidity Testing

- Write Solidity tests targeting the following contracts:
  - UniswapV2Router02
  - UniswapV2Pair
  - UniswapV2Factory
- Aim for test coverage exceeding 95% for each contract.
- Generate and commit a line coverage report to evaluate the effectiveness of the tests.

## Resources

- Utilize online resources to enhance understanding and resolve implementation challenges.
